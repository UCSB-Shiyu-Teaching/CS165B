# CS165B: Introduction to Machine Learning

This is an introductory class in the field of machine learning. Throughout the course, students will delve into the basic principles of machine learning. By the end of the course, students will 1) understand the foundation, classic techniques, applications, and challenges of machine learning; 2) be able to apply basic machine learning algorithms to solve real-world problems.
